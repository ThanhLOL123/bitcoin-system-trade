# Bitcoin Trading System

This project is a comprehensive, event-driven Bitcoin trading system designed for real-time data analysis, machine learning-based signal generation, and automated trade execution. It leverages a microservices architecture, with components communicating via Kafka message queues. The system is designed for scalability and resilience, with Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

## Architecture

The system is composed of the following services:

*   **Data Collector**: Gathers real-time data from various sources, including cryptocurrency exchanges (CoinGecko), news feeds, and social media (Reddit). It publishes this data to Kafka topics.
*   **Feature Engineering**: Consumes raw data from Kafka, performs feature engineering (e.g., calculating technical indicators, sentiment analysis), and stores the features in a feature store.
*   **ML Pipeline**: Trains and serves machine learning models. It uses MLflow for model lifecycle management and a PostgreSQL database for the backend store.
*   **Trading Bot**: The core of the system, this service implements the trading logic. It consumes signals from the ML pipeline, manages the portfolio, and executes trades via the MT5 trading terminal.
*   **API**: A FastAPI application that provides a RESTful API for interacting with the system, including endpoints for health checks and machine learning model inference.
*   **MT5 RPC Server**: A server that provides a remote procedure call (RPC) interface to a MetaTrader 5 (MT5) terminal, allowing the trading bot to execute trades.

The system also includes a monitoring stack with Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Docker
*   Docker Compose
*   Python 3.9+
*   An MT5 trading account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThanhLOL123/bitcoin-system-trade.git
    cd bitcoin-trading-system
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**

    Create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` and fill in the required values, including your MT5 account credentials and API keys for data sources.

3.  **Build and run the services:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## Usage

The system is designed to run continuously. The trading bot will automatically execute trades based on the signals generated by the machine learning models.

You can monitor the system's performance and health via the Grafana dashboards, which are available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development

The project is organized into several Python packages, each corresponding to a microservice. The source code is located in the `src` directory.

### Dependencies

The project's dependencies are managed in the `requirements.txt` and `requirements.data_collector.txt` files. To install the dependencies for local development, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.data_collector.txt
```

### Testing

The project includes a suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```
